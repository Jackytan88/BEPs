## Abstract

[EIP-7685](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7685.md) introduces requests into the block body and adds requests_hash to the block header. To achieve compatibility, these elements must be defined in BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

## Motivation

The goal is to make the block format compatible with EIP-7685. This allows for shared codebases and APIs between implementations, promoting consistency and interoperability.

## Specification

### Block Body

Define `requests` as an empty array:
```golang
requests = make(types.Requests, 0)
```

### Block Header

In accordance with EIP-7685, add `requests_hash` to the end of the block header:
```golang
block.header.requests_hash = compute_requests_hash(requests)
```
When calculating the header signature, ensure that requests_hash is included in the computation.
